# DataVisualization Chart
This project contains one WinForm which includes:
- Two Panels
- One Button to be clicked to draw the chart.
- One ComboBox to select the chart type.
- Chart from Windows.Form.DataVisualization Reference (to be added as reference to the project).
  
Windows DataVisulaiztion was used in this example. the shape of chart would change based on the comboBox selection (to select the chart type)
dotNet Framework 4.6.2 was usied in this example.

- Note: in future I am looking to connect this chart to PI AF SDK.
- Note: in future I am looking to use dotNet 8.
